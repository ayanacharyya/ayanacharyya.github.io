							<p align="left">I am actively involved in outreach activities here at Mount Stromlo Observatory. We  often host public 
							open nights, school visits and private star gazing sessions.</p>
							
							
							<p align="left">At Stromlo we typically have a few (~5-8) school nights every month, depending on the season, where a group (20-50)
							of school children, mostly from outside Canberra, come to Mount Stromlo. Each night is hosted typically by 
							2-4 outreach volunteers, including students from RSAA and volunteers from the Canberra Astronomical
							Society (CAS). We take the visitors around on a tour of the facilities and heritage sites
							around the mountain, host Q&A and star gazing sessions.</p>
							
							<p align="left">Private nights are somewhat similar, but with fewer (~2-5) visitors. Public nights, on the other hand, 
							witness over a thousand people coming up to attend the public talks and huge star gazing sessions, which run
							parallely. I enjoy talking to non-astronomers about the research that we do here!</p>
							
							<p align="left">So far I have been involved in over 30 outreach/public astronomy events, including the World Record
							Stargazing event 2018 at ANU.  I also give talks aimed for the general public, including events like 'Physics in the pub'. 
							In 2019 I talked at a few universities and engineering colleges in India to nurture the 
							curiosity and interest of young students in astronomy.
							
							<p align="left">I was the <a href="https://www.ayersrockresort.com.au/events/detail/astronomer-in-residence-program"> Astronomer in Residence</a> 
							at Ayers Rock Resort in Uluru for two weeks in July 2018. It was a very enriching experience to learn about Indigenous astronomy from the Star Talker team there.
							I enjoyed talking about Australian astronomy to the diverse tourist population visitng Uluru and helping them stargaze under the pristine dark skies of outback Australia. 
							Here are some photos! </p>
