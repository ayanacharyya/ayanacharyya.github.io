 <li> <b> Dr David Nicholls </b> </li> 
   <p><img src="./photos/DavidNicholls.jpg" width="175" height="195" marginheight="5" marginwidth="0" style="float:left; margin:5px" >An enthusiastic amateur astronomer 
from the age of 10, after graduating 
with a BSc(Hons  in physics from ANU, 
David's formal involvement in 
astronomy began at Mt Stromlo as a 
Summer Vacation Scholar in 1968. At 
that time there were only two 
computers at ANU, one of which was 
an IBM 1620 at Mt Stromlo, on which 
he learned to program in FORTRAN 
II.</p>
<p> Instead of pursuing a career in 
astronomy, he headed off to Canada to do his MSc in Upper Atmosphere Physics at the University of 
Saskatchewan.  Due to government cutbacks in the US and 
Canada, it became pretty clear that a career in physics was not a 
good idea, so he joined the Australian Public Service, working in 
science and technology policy and grants program areas. </p>
<p> In 1998 he jumped ship and set up a web design and 
management consultancy.  Then in 2008, instead of taking the 
obvious course of retiring to a life of golf and bridge, he started 
back at Mt Stromlo to finish off the long deferred PhD, working 
under the supervision of Mike Dopita and Helmut Jerjen. Since 
graduating in 2014, he has been employed as a Post-Doctoral 
Fellow at RSAA, working with Lisa Kewley, Ralph Sutherland and 
Mike Dopita. His interests are mainly in the physics of ionised 
nebulae.  He has no plans to quit just yet! </p>
<p> If you have a question for David, he is a 
member of our panel on working life inside and 
outside academia at 11:30 on Thursday!</p>

 <li> <b> Dr Christopher Thom </b> </li> 
   <p><img src="./photos/ChristopherThom.jpg" width="270" height="195" marginheight="5" marginwidth="0" style="float:left; margin:5px" > Christopher Thom received his 
PhD in astronomy from 
Swinburne University in 2006, 
working on the high-velocity cloud 
problem to understand gas flows 
into the Milky Way</p>
<p> After his PhD he did postdocs at 
the University of Chicago and 
Space Telescope Science 
Institute, primarily working on the 
low-z IGM and the gas-galaxy 
connection using HSTs UV 
spectrographs. He made the 
transition from academia to 
business in 2012, joining Quantium, where he applies his statistical and data analysis skills to 
business problems.</p>
<p> Most of his work is in using machinedlearning approaches to 
leverage the power of large datasets for clients. Most recently he is 
responsible for the content of the emails you might (or might not  get 
from Woolworths. At Quantium, his team has built a large-scale 
predictive model to personalise the offers that every Woolworths 
customer gets in their emails. </p>
<p> He has helped a number of other astronomers make the jump from 
academia to business, mostly in Data Science roles, and he loves 
helping people understand their options.</p>
<p> Christopher is a member of our panel on working 
life inside and outside of academia. If you have a 
question for Christopher, you will have the 
opportunity to find the answer during our panel 
discussion at 11:30 on Thursday.</p>

 <li> <b> Prof. Dr. Martin Asplund </b> </li> 
   <p><img src="./photos/MartinAsplund5.jpeg" width="175" height="195" marginheight="5" marginwidth="0" style="float:left; margin:5px" > Prof. Martin Asplund is an ARC Laureate Fellow and a Fellow of
the Australian Academy of Science. Before returning to ANU as a professor
in 2011 he was director of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in 
Germany. He leads the Galactic Archaeology and Stellar Physics group 
at ANU which currently consists besides of himself of four ARC Future Fellows, 
two ARC DECRA Fellows, four postdocs, five PhD students and three 
professors. </p>
    <p>His research is focussed on stellar astrophysics 
(atmospheres, spectroscopy, evolution, nucleosynthesis) and 
using stars as probes of the cosmos, from the origin of the solar system
and extrasolar planets to the origin of the elements and the history of the
Milky Way. He straddles observations, computations and theory in roughly
equal measure; he is one the heaviest user of the largest optical telescopes
as well as supercomputers in Australia.</p>
    <p>Over the past 15 years he has
been the main supervisor of 16 PhD students and 24 postdoctoral fellows
while mentoring many more early career researchers in Australia and abroad.</p>
<p> Martin will be sharing some of his famous 
“unsolicited advice” on navigating life in 
academia at 3:30 on Thursday, which should lead 
to some lively dinner discussions.!</p>

 <li> <b> Dr. Joao Bento </b> </li> 
   <p><img src="./photos/JoaoBento.jpg" width="175" height="210" marginheight="5" marginwidth="0" style="float:left; margin:5px" > Joao Bento is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at ANU's Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics. His primary research focus is in Exoplanet discovery and characterisation as well as astronomical software. He is the Australian HATSouth node manager and is a current and former member of various teams related to the search and confirmation of exoplanets, including SuperWASP, the Next Generation Transit Search (NGTS), the Kilo-degree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT-South) and the Transiting Exoplanet CHaracterisation project (TECH). </p>
   <p>He was awarded a MSci degree from Imperial College, London and a PhD from Warwick University before taking a postdoc position at Macquarie University working on instrumentation for astronomy with small telescopes. He then moved his position to ANU to continue and expand his research focus and technical areas. </p>
   <p>Throughout his professional career so far, a large emphasis was devoted to software pipelines, computational techniques, database and system management in the context of various projects. He is currently working with the Data Reduction Software team for the upcoming Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) soon to be commissioned at the Gemini telescopes in Chile.</p>
   <p>Joao spends most of his time windsurfing, rock climbing, playing pool and music, and very occasionally some time is devoted to that astronomy stuff he's paid for.</p>
<p>Joao will be sharing valuable insights 
into astronomy software tools at the 
conclusion of the student talks on 
Friday</p>
