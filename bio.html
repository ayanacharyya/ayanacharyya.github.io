                                Prof. Somnath Bharadwaj </a>. My Masters project involved simulations of the emitted radiation bubble from Quasars, to have a better understanding of 
                                the reionization epoch. I was mainly involved in improving and testing of the C- based code of 
                                the simulation.</li>

                                The project required me to work mainly on simulating artificial galaxies and modeling them using 
                                a genetic algorithm called Ferret, which is based on MATLAB. The project primarily consisted of 
                                coding in MATLAB. Also, visualization techniques were later applied on these generates galaxy 
                                models using softwares like GIMP and Processing. The project was funded through the MITACS
