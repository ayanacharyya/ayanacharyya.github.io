							<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>
							<p align="left">I am interested in galaxy evolution. Specifically, I 
							quantify how properties of the ISM -- like metallicity, ionization parameter, pressure
							and electron temperature -- evolve with redshift, particularly in the high-redshift (1 < z < 4)
							regime.</p>

							<h3 align="left">Probing nebular conditions in high-z galaxies with rest-frame UV diagnostics</h3>

							<p align="left">Optical to infrared astronomy is perched at an exciting platform today, with large, space
							(JWST) and ground (GMT) based telescopes coming up. We will mostly be observing the rest-frame UV
							light from distant galaxies because the rest-frame optical spectra are redshifted
							beyond the telescope wavelength coverage. Before using the rest-frame UV light, it is crucial to understand what information
							the rest-frame UV emission lines carry. To devise and test the new UV diagnostics we take advantage of the magnification 
							power of gravitational lensing. We apply the new rest-frame UV emission line diagnostics from Kewley et al. 2017 (submitted) and Nicholls et al. (in prep) and
							to a bright lensed galaxy at z~1.7. Once we understand how useful the different UV
							diagnostics are, we will apply them to our full sample of high-z UV spectra.</p>

							<h3 align="left">Investigating effects of telescope resolution on the inferred metallicity gradient of galaxies</h3>

							<p align="left">Simply observing the emission lines is not enough to infer the properties of galaxies, if we do not understand the impact 
							of telescope limitations on the line fluxes. In this project we are trying to investigate
							what effect the various instrumental limitations have on the measured lines. In particular, we
							focus on the effect of telescope (spatial) resolution on the inferred metallicity gradient. 
							How fine a resolution do we need to recover the true metallicity gradient of a galaxy?</p>
							
							<p align="left">We approach the problem by making synthetic position-position-velocity data cubes from simulations
							of isolated Milky Way-type galaxy (Goldbaum et al. 2016). This process involves modelling HII regions
							around young stars in the simulation and looking up photoionization model grids to estimate the 
							emission line fluxes. We subsequently include the effects of noise as well as spectral and spatial smoothing
							to produce a synthetic data cube from which the metallicity gradient can be extracted. The idea is to 
							build a generic pipeline so that we can input any simulation, in future, and output the mock data cube.</p>
