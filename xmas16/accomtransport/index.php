<h2>Accommodation in Canberra</h2>

	<b>There is no public transport to Mt Stromlo Observatory from town.</b> For those without a car, you can make your way to and from the seminars via the student shuttle bus which stops at the main ANU campus. The shuttle bus stop is indicated on the map on the right. 
	<p2> Please contact us if you are not staying near the campus and do not have a car so that we can organise a lift with students or 
	staff.</p2>
